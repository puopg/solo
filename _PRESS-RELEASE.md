There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
    Pointer Precision Trainer

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
    For gamers looking for a way to improve their accuracy with a mouse. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
    This is a simple point and click game where the player tries to click on enemies. For each enemy destroyed, the player is granted 1 point, but when the player misses, he loses 3 points, which can cause the player's score to become negative until it reaches a minimum at which point, he will lose. As time goes by, the level will increase and the frequency of enemies spawning increases. For each enemy that is not destroyed in time, the player loses a life until the player has run out. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
    This game is a way to practice muscle memory and pointer precision from any computer. It is easy to play via the web browser and requires very few resources to run. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
    Enemies appear as circles that expand at a constant rate. As the player moves through the levels, they must be more accurate and fast with their clicks so as to not lose. This trains the mouse hand of most gamers to develop muscle memory in order to 'snap' to different locations on the screen. After the player has lost, data concerning their performance is reported back and the player can understand where they performed well, and where they did not. This feedback can be used by the player to focus more on certain areas. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
    "It's never gg, till it's gg" - Michael Chen, CEO of HAM Apps

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
    Simply visit the web page and the game will begin loading. Once you are ready, press the start button and the game will begin. When you are finished with a game, your statistics will be presented and you can begin a new game. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
    "This game is deceptively simple, easy to play, but hard to master. I definitely feel like I have improved my game simply by playing a few minutes during the queue between games." - Soren Bjerg, Mid laner for Team SoloMid - League of Legends

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
    I hope that you will enjoy this game and find how easy it is to improve your game by spending a few minutes a day with this app. If you are unsure about muscle memory and how it impacts competitive video games, please visit: http://www.teamliquid.net/blogs/165836-muscle-memory-its-all-in-the-mind.
